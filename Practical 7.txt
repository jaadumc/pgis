Practical 7
Managing Data Tables and Saptial data Sets: 
a) Table joins
➢ Start a new project 
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add new Vector Layer
“I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\A\Data\tl_2013_06_tract.zip”
➢ We could import this csv file without any further action and it would be imported. But, the default 
type of each column would be a String (text). That is ok except for the D001 field which contains 
numbers for the population. Having those imported as text would not allow us to run any 
mathematical operations on this column. To tell QGIS to import the field as a number, we need to 
create a sidecar file with a .csvt extension.
➢ This file will have only 1 row specifying data types for each column. Save this file as 
ca_tracts_pop.csvt in the same directory as the original .csv file.
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer
And add I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\A\Data\ca_tacts_pop.csv”
➢ In the layer panel, Right click on “tl_2013_06_tract”, layer and select Properties
➢ Select the option in Properties, and click on button to add new table join.
➢ In the Add Vector Join window set the following properties and click OK.
➢ After performing join 
➢ For more clear output, select “tl_2013_06_tact” from Layer Panel, right click and select 
properties. Go to Symbology and set the following properties.
➢ A detailed and accurate population map of California can be seen as the result. Same technique 
can be used to create maps based on variety of census data.



b) spatial joins
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer → Select 
“I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\B\Data\nybb_12c\nybb_13c_av\nybb.shp” and
“I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\B\Data\OEM_NursingHomes_001\OEM_NursingHo
mes_001.shp”, from data folder.
➢ Go to attribute table and observe the data.
➢ Table before performing Join 
➢ Go to Vector → Data Management Tools → Join Attributes by Location
➢ Attribute table after join
➢ Use the Identify Feature Button to select a region to view join data on map Layer. 
➢ Output



c) Points in polygon analysis
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer
Select “EarthQuakeDatabase.txt”
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add Delimited Text Layer
“I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\C\Data\ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip”
➢ Use the select Feature i button to check country wise counting of Earthquakes.
➢ Also a new column is added to attribute table “NumPoints” indicating number of earth quake 
points in each country.


d) Performing spatial queries
➢ Go to Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer and load
“\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\D\Data\ne_10m_populated_places_simple\ne_10m_popul
ated_places_simple.shp” and 
“I:\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_07\D\Data\ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines\ne_10m_rivers
_lake_centerlines.shp” from project data folder.
➢ Open project Properties → Set CRS “World_Azimuthal_Equidistant EPSG 54032” . The map will 
be re-projected as
➢ Go to Vector → Geoprocessing Tool → Buffer
➢ Repeat the step to create River Buffer
➢ Create a buffer for River
➢ Go to Vector → Research Tool → Select By Location
➢ This will highlight only those rivers containing a populated place within 2 KM
