Working with Projections and WMS Data
A Web Map Service (WMS) is a standard protocol developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium in 
1999 for serving georeferenced map images over the Internet. These images are typically produced by a 
map server from data provided by a GIS database
➢ Start a new Project.
➢ Layer → Add Layer →Vector Layer
➢ Select “ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip” Layer from data folder.
➢ Go to Layer → Save As
Select format as ESRI Shape File
Select folder location and file name
Set CRS North_America_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic EPSG: 102008
➢ Press “OK”. 
➢ Deselect the original Image and keep the projected layer visible.
➢ Select Layer → Add Layer → Add Raster Layer → Select MiniScale_(standard)_R17.tif from 
Location 
“GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_05\DATA\minisc_gb\minisc_gb\data\RGB_TIF_compres
sed\MiniScale_(standard)_R17.tif”
➢ The Layer appears on a different location than the location where Great Britain is shown on 
Map.
➢ Open Layer Properties→CRS → Search bri → select British National Grid EPSG 27700.
➢ Processing may take some time.
➢ Locate United Kingdom on Layer; the vector layer exactly coincides by the raster layer
covering United Kingdom.
