a)Adding vector layer
b)Setting properties
c)Vector Layer Formatting

Procedure:

a. Adding vector layers(Polygon,Line,Points)
	
	-Polygon layers(We have taken 2 layers Matunga,Garden)
	-Line layers(we have taken 3 layers Small_Roads,Road,Flyover)
	-Point layers(We have taken 4 layers bank,college,Restaurants,ATM)

b.Setting properties(Labelling,Symbolism)

Our aim is to create map representing a location and its surrounding as follows:

  a) Creating Polygon vector layer
	
	-select Project----->New
	-select Layer--->Create Layer---->New Shapefile Layer

  -Following dialog box will appear on the screen.Select Polygon option from   
	Geometry type.

  -Fill the appropriate information in each text box.
	. File name:
		-By default the file will be saved in bin folder.
		-To avoid it click on following button to change the location of file.
  -Field panel
	=Add the attribute you want to show.(Column Name for table)
	b. Specify Type(DataType:Text Data/Decimal Data/Whole Number/Date)of Attribute
	c. Specify the Length of the attribute. Specify Precision(If Data Type is Decimal)
  - Click on Add to Field list Button.
  - You can add as many fields (Column Name) as you want for the layer.
  - Select Geometry Type as follows
	. Click on the following buttons
  - The CRS dialog box will appear on screen.Click on the WGS84 option and it will be selected as follows.Click on OK

a) Follow the steps to plot Polygon features.
- Select the Polygon Feature(in our case it is Matunga for background)from layer panel
-Click Toggle Editing Button(pencil icon)---> Click on Add Polygon icon---->now place the cursor at the location where you want to place the 	polygon . for polygon layer minimum 3 points should be selected 

- Save the newly added polygon as follows.
		id:1, Name:Matunga

-set style for polygon by using property window(Right Click on Matunga 	Layer)
- Following screen will appear on the screen. Select pattern as you want and click on OK.
- Same way we can add one more polygon layer for Gardens.

b)Creating Line vector layer

-Repeat the same steps as we have done for ploygon layer.
-Select geometry type Line.

-Road Layer:
  - To plot click on Add Line Feature.
  - Click on the map where you want to draw line.
  - Once you are done then right click on map(Dotted line turn into solid line)
  - save your data

Road-Feature Attributes--->id:1,Name:Matunga Pool

- set style for Roads in the same way as we have done for polygon
- Properties--->Symbology------>Topo road.

- Road will look as below
- To label your roads Right CLick on Road Layer. Go to properties window then select label and set single label property
- Window will appear on the screen----> Click ok

- To merge roads
	. Go to properties of road then select symbology. Click on Advanced button select Symbol levels.
	. Check Enable symbol Levels option
	. Click OK and road will appear

c) Create Point vector layer
	- Repeat same steps to add point layers as we have done in previous layers(For ATM,Restaurants,Banks,Bus Stops etc)

d) Calculating line lengths and statistics

- Go to layer--->Add layer--->Add Vector layer
- Add the following file to project
	"\GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_01\D\DATA\IND_rrd\IND_rails.shp"
	Press"ADD"
- Also add india Administrative Map
	"GIS_Workshop\Practicals\Practical_01\D\DATA\IND_adm0.shp1"
- Double Click on IND_adm0
- Select Symbology---->Select any outline style from below given options.

Press OK
- The display window will appear like(India Map will lines inside).

- In Layer Pane,Right click on IND_rails--->Open Attribute Table

- Press Toggle Editing button using (pencil) button, on Attribute table 	wndow toolbar.
- Press Open Field Calculator using (Calculator icon)button.
- Set the output field as "Track_Len",field type to "Decimal Number",field 	Length to 0  and precision to 2.
- From Function List search $length or go to Geometry--->Select $length
- Set expression as ($length/1000)
-Press OK

- A new column is added to the attribute table with value representing the 	 length of track in KM.
- Press CTRL+S or click on Save Edits option on tool bar
- Close the attribute table window.
- For calculating the total length of Railway tracks in India.
- Select Vector---->Analysis Tools---->Basic statics for Fields
- Select IND_rails layer from input layer.And select Track_Len in "Field to Calculate statistics on".

- Press RUN
- Open the "output.html" file to get the field statistics.
-The above statistics show that the total length of Raiway track in India is
	60,479.32 KM
